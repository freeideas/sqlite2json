# Req Fix 01 Cli [RESPONSE]
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-14-16-31-10-658
**Requirement:** N/A

---

## Response

The fix has been applied. 

**Summary of changes made:**

Fixed **$REQ_CLI_013** source attribution:
- Changed `**Source:** ./specs/HELP.txt` to `**Source:** ./specs/behavior.md (Section: "Command-line handling")`
- Changed "match the format specified" to "match the content specified" (minor wording improvement)

The issue was that `./specs/HELP.txt` is a plain text file, not a markdown file with sections, so it didn't follow the proper source attribution format. The actual source of the requirement (that help text should match HELP.txt) is in `./specs/behavior.md` which says "The help text (see `HELP.txt`) is printed to stdout".

Let me analyze the requirements document against the eight rules:\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **$REQ_CLI_001-002**: \u2705 Correct - matches README Usage section\n2. **$REQ_CLI_003-004**: \u2705 Correct - matches README Output section  \n3. **$REQ_CLI_005**: \u2705 Correct - matches README Output section\n4. **$REQ_CLI_006**: This is implied by $REQ_CLI_003 and $REQ_CLI_004 which describe the output format including \"one row per line\" and the row format. It's also duplicated from specs/behavior.md which says the same thing. However, checking Rule 8: if $REQ_CLI_003 or $REQ_CLI_004 fail, would $REQ_CLI_006 also fail? Not necessarily - the output could have proper formatting but wrong row shape. So it's not implied. \u2705 Keep.\n5. **$REQ_CLI_007**: \u2705 Correct - matches specs/behavior.md \"Value mapping\" section\n6. **$REQ_CLI_008-012**: \u2705 Correct - matches specs/behavior.md \"Command-line handling\" section\n7. **$REQ_CLI_013**: The source is cited as `./specs/HELP.txt` but this is not actually a section within a markdown file. The source should be `./specs/behavior.md (Section: \"Command-line handling\")` since that section references HELP.txt. However, HELP.txt is a legitimate source file. This is a minor issue - the format should specify \"Section\" or clarify it's the whole file.\n\nLooking more closely at **$REQ_CLI_009, $REQ_CLI_010, $REQ_CLI_011** - these are all situations where help is printed. They could potentially be combined with $REQ_CLI_008, but they are distinct testable behaviors (different triggers for the same action). They are NOT implied by each other since each tests a different condition.\n\n**$REQ_CLI_005** - \"Row and column order in output are whatever SQLite returns.\" - This is actually observable behavior that can be tested. Keep it.\n\n**$REQ_CLI_013** - Source attribution needs fixing. It cites `./specs/HELP.txt` but that's a text file, not a markdown file with sections. The actual requirement to match HELP.txt comes from `./specs/behavior.md (Section: \"Command-line handling\")` which says \"The help text (see `HELP.txt`) is printed to stdout\".\n\nLet me fix the source attribution for $REQ_CLI_013:"

The actual source of the requirement (that help text should match HELP.txt) is in `./specs/behavior.md` which says \"The help text (see `HELP.txt`) is printed to stdout\".",
