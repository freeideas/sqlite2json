# Req Fix 01 Cli [RESPONSE]
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-14-16-32-25-149
**Requirement:** N/A

---

## Response

Now I have all the source documentation. Let me analyze the requirements document against the eight rules:

**Analysis:**

1. **Complete Coverage** - All testable CLI behaviors appear covered.

2. **No Invention** - $REQ_CLI_013 references `./specs/HELP.txt` but the source (behavior.md) says "The help text (see `HELP.txt`) is printed to stdout". The spec points to HELP.txt as a reference for what the help text IS, not as a requirement that it "must match exactly". However, the spec does reference HELP.txt as defining the help text content, so this is reasonable.

3. **No Overspecification** - Requirements look appropriately specified.

4. **Tell Stories** - Requirements are in reasonable order.

5. **Source Attribution** - All have proper attribution. Let me verify README also mentions `--help` since $REQ_CLI_008 is cited from behavior.md.
   - README says: "Use `--help` to see usage information. Help is also shown for any command-line errors."
   - So $REQ_CLI_008 could also cite README.md (Section: "Usage"), but behavior.md is more detailed, so it's fine.

6. **Unique IDs** - All IDs are unique.

7. **Reasonably Testable** - All requirements are testable.

8. **No Implied Requirements** - Let me check:
   - $REQ_CLI_009 (Help on No Arguments), $REQ_CLI_010 (Help on Unrecognized Arguments), $REQ_CLI_011 (Help on Missing/Invalid Required Args) -- these are distinct conditions from behavior.md, all testable separately. Not implied by each other.
   - $REQ_CLI_005 (Row and Column Order) and $REQ_CLI_006 (Row Shape) -- these describe different aspects: order vs structure. Not implied by each other.

**Issue Found:**

Looking at $REQ_CLI_013:
- The source (behavior.md) says: "The help text (see `HELP.txt`) is printed to stdout"
- The requirement says: "The help text output must match the content specified in ./specs/HELP.txt"

This is an accurate interpretation -- behavior.md references HELP.txt as the source of the help text content. The requirement correctly captures that the help text should match HELP.txt. The source path `./specs/HELP.txt` vs just `HELP.txt` is a reasonable clarification since HELP.txt is in the specs folder.

Actually, wait -- let me re-read the source attribution for $REQ_CLI_013. It says the source is behavior.md section "Command-line handling". Let me verify this matches:

behavior.md says: "The help text (see `HELP.txt`) is printed to stdout in these cases"

This establishes that HELP.txt defines the help text. The requirement accurately reflects this. The attribution is correct.

**All requirements appear correct.** No issues found that warrant changes.

The file should be left unchanged.

Help is also shown for any command-line errors.\n\n## Output\n\n- With `--sql`: writes a JSON list, with `[` on its own line, one row per line, and `]` on the last line.\n- Without `--sql`: writes a JSON list of tables. It starts with `[` on its own line and ends with `]` on its own line. Each table object has attributes `TABLE_NAME` and `ROWS`. `ROWS` is the same list format as `SELECT * FROM [TABLE_NAME]`, including `[` and `]` on their own lines. Each table object starts with `{` on its own line and ends with `}` on its own line.\n\nEach row is a JSON object with keys as column names and values as the field values. Row and column order are whatever SQLite returns; you can control both with `--sql`.\n\nBoth outputs are valid JSON in a line-oriented style similar to NDJSON.\n",

The spec points to HELP.txt as a reference for what the help text IS, not as a requirement that it \"must match exactly\". However, the spec does reference HELP.txt as defining the help text content, so this is reasonable.\n\n3. **No Overspecification** - Requirements look appropriately specified.\n\n4. **Tell Stories** - Requirements are in reasonable order.\n\n5. **Source Attribution** - All have proper attribution. Let me verify README also mentions `--help` since $REQ_CLI_008 is cited from behavior.md.\n   - README says: \"Use `--help` to see usage information. Help is also shown for any command-line errors.\"\n   - So $REQ_CLI_008 could also cite README.md (Section: \"Usage\"), but behavior.md is more detailed, so it's fine.\n\n6. **Unique IDs** - All IDs are unique.\n\n7. **Reasonably Testable** - All requirements are testable.\n\n8. **No Implied Requirements** - Let me check:\n   - $REQ_CLI_009 (Help on No Arguments), $REQ_CLI_010 (Help on Unrecognized Arguments), $REQ_CLI_011 (Help on Missing/Invalid Required Args) -- these are distinct conditions from behavior.md, all testable separately. Not implied by each other.\n   - $REQ_CLI_005 (Row and Column Order) and $REQ_CLI_006 (Row Shape) -- these describe different aspects: order vs structure.
