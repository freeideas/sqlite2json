# Req Fix 01 Cli [RESPONSE]
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-14-16-27-23-304
**Requirement:** N/A

---

## Response

Done. I made two fixes to the requirements document:

1. **$REQ_CLI_004 (Accuracy fix)**: Changed "JSON object tree" starting with `{` to "JSON list of tables" starting with `[`. The README clearly states "writes a JSON list of tables" and "starts with `[`", not a JSON object.

2. **$REQ_CLI_006 (Source fix)**: Changed source from `./specs/behavior.md` to `./README.md` since the README explicitly documents this behavior ("Each row is a JSON object with keys as column names and values as the field values").

The requirement says \"writes a JSON object tree\" and \"starts with `{`\". This contradicts the README.\n\n2. **$REQ_CLI_006 (Source Attribution)**: The source is cited as `./specs/behavior.md (Section: \"Row shape and ordering\")`, but this information is also in `./README.md (Section: \"Output\")` which says \"Each row is a JSON object with keys as column names and values as the field values.\" The README should be the primary source since it's mentioned there.\n\n3. **$REQ_CLI_013 (Source Validity)**: It cites `./specs/HELP.txt` which exists, but the format `**Source:** ./specs/HELP.txt` doesn't follow the pattern of specifying a section. This is acceptable since HELP.txt is the complete file.\n\nLet me fix the inaccuracy in $REQ_CLI_004:"
